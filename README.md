### How Does The Pathfinder 2e System Work?

If you are unfamiliar with how game systems like Pathfinder 2e work, here is a basic lay down.

The game is based on a system of rolling dice to play. The main dice you will use is a D20 (a twenty-sided dice). You roll to see what degree of success you’ve gotten from a specific check. There are four different states of success: critical failure, failure, success, and critical success. When you roll a d20, if you roll a 1 then you automatically fail that check. If you roll a 20, then your initial degree of success is increased by one degree.

If you are exploring, then you must pass a DC check (difficulty check) with a D20 plus your ability modifier. If you are attacking a monster, you must roll over their AC (armor class) with a D20 plus your attack modifier. If you are dodging a hazard or attack, you must roll over the DC check (difficulty check) with a d20 plus your save modifier. The same rules apply to monsters when attacking you. All damage incurred from failing a check uses smaller pools of dice to calculate damage including D4s, D6s, D8s, D10s, and D12s.

### How Do I Play The Game?

The game is a simple input-based game. You explore and navigate the game by typing in various inputs when prompted. Type ‘Help’ at any time to learn more about the inputs you can type in during exploration.

### Starting The Game

To begin the game, you must create your character with their name and selected class.

There are four classes to choose from: Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, and Bard.

Fighters and Rogues are melee classes. They use actions in hand-to-hand combat. Their strongest attacks have cooldowns, so you must pay attention to what has been used. Wizards and Bards are spellcaster classes. They use actions that consume mana. You have a limited mana pool, so make sure you are not overusing your most powerful spells.

Each class has specific actions they can take, impacting both combat and exploration. Each class also has different health pools, mana pools, saving throws, and abilities. Abilities include strength, dexterity, constitution, wisdom, intelligence, and charisma.

### Exploring The Game

Once you are all set up, you may begin your adventure.

You begin your adventure at the entrance of a cave, you are given a general description of what you are experiencing and seeing when you first enter. You have various choices for exploration.

You, as the player, can input various commands to explore and interact with the world around you. Most actions require you to make a ‘skill roll’ (adding a D20 and adding your ability modifier). You have standard actions such as ‘look’ and ‘recall’ to get a general glimpse of the scene around you. You also have other actions to explore and solve puzzles such as ‘talk’, ‘pet’, ‘intimidate’, ‘jump’, and many others to choose from. Try to think of the appropriate action your character would take to complete the room or puzzle. Remember, you may type ‘Help’ at any time to get a larger list of standard actions you can take.

If you happen to encounter a creature during your adventure, know that there are several options available to get out of the encounter peacefully. These answers will not be given to you. Exploration is important.

If you encounter a creature and things do not end peacefully, then an encounter will begin. Each round the creature and you will take a turn to take an action from their attack list. There is variability in what actions you can take, depending on your character so do be sure to take note of what you can do.

Once a room is cleared, you may explore and navigate to other rooms. This is done through simple north, south, east, and west commands to navigate. Note, that if a room was not cleared or failed, certain rooms or options may not be available to you.
